# The Button
Write a contract in Solidity that is similar to The Button on reddit (r/thebutton), where participants pay a fixed amount of ether to call press_button, and then if 3 blocks pass without someone calling press_button, whoever pressed the button last can call claim_treasure and get the other participantsâ€™ deposits. 

## Run

yarn && yarn run build && yarn run compile && yarn run test
